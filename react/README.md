# Map with Weather

Create an app which will display a weather for a list of cities on the map. 


## Requirements

1. Project must be done React.js.
2. You should use typescript.
3. Project should be deployed and be available live (use Github pages, Heroku or any other free hosting).
4. Use [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to add a map.
5. You can use any other additional libs if you need, it is up to you.
6. App should be responsive and usable on mobile/tablet/desktop screens

## Your task
1. There should be a sidebar with 20 random cities from all over the world (up to you, select any you want). 
2. There should be an input which will start filter cities by entered value (mini search). It should filter cities only from available list.
3. When I click on a city name from the list, I should switch to it on a map. There should be displayed an information icon (you can use [any from the internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=information+icon+png&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwixk6mQy-L8AhVVEXcKHZPMDBkQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=information+icon+png&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIGCAAQBRAeMgYIABAFEB4yBggAEAUQHjIGCAAQBRAeOgQIIxAnUPABWN4HYMYIaABwAHgAgAGCAYgBwgOSAQMwLjSYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=Zw7RY_HDHNWi3AOTmbPIAQ&bih=1329&biw=2560) or from any [font icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)).
4. When I click an icon, I should see a mapbox popup with a weather forecast. Please, add a forecast for today and tomorrow (design is up to you)

You can use any additional libs you need to complete the task.
